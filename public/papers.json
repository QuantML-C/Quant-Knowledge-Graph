    "abstract": "Market efficiency is a central issue in asset pricing and investment management, but changes in efficiency levels are rarely discussed. This paper argues that over the past 30+ years, markets have become less informationally efficient in the relative pricing of common stocks, particularly over medium horizons. Three hypotheses are proposed, with technologies like social media identified as a major factor. The paper suggests that investors willing to exploit these inefficiencies may achieve higher expected returns but also face greater risks. It concludes with strategies to maintain rational, diversifying approaches in a less-efficient market.",

Over 500 simulated market days, DTX learned by observing prices generated by other strategies, creating a mapping from market data to bid/ask orders. Trained on historical Level-2 market data (Limit Order Book), DTX processes market states to determine order prices. The model was tested against leading strategies in the literature, with results validated through statistical analysis. DTX demonstrated the ability to rival and often surpass the performance of public-domain traders, including those outperforming human traders. The findings highlight the potential of simple Deep Learning models in complex market simulations and their efficiency in financial markets.",

The authors demonstrate that commonly used earnings measures, which have high transitory volatility, are uninformative about stock price movements. They propose using Street earnings, which exclude transitory items, as a more stable and informative measure. The resulting Street PE ratio is shown to be highly informative about stock price movements and future returns. The study finds that the Street PE has superior in- and out-of-sample explanatory power for predicting returns compared to other valuation ratios. Additionally, it reconciles conflicting views on the subjective expectations driving stock prices, showing that expectations of short-term earnings, long-term earnings growth, and returns all contribute to explaining the excess volatility puzzle.",

This paper introduces Style Miner, a reinforcement learning approach that formulates the problem as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), maximizing explanatory power while ensuring stability through constraints. The method employs fine-grained rewards and costs, using a Lagrangian heuristic for adaptive balancing. Experiments on financial datasets demonstrate that Style Miner outperforms existing learning-based methods and achieves a 10% higher R-squared explanatory power compared to expert-designed factors.",

However, existing frameworks often fail to adapt to specialized simulation contexts due to the lack of context labels, insufficient precision in generating context-aligned data, and the inherent noise and non-stationarity of financial data. This paper introduces Market-GAN, a novel architecture combining Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), an autoencoder, and supervisors for controllable financial data generation. The proposed Contextual Market Dataset includes market dynamics, stock ticker, and history state as context, extracted via a hybrid market dynamics modeling method. Market-GAN employs a two-stage training scheme to ensure accurate market distribution capture and addresses mode collapse issues. Evaluated on Dow Jones Industrial Average data from 2000-2023, Market-GAN outperforms four state-of-the-art time-series generative models in alignment, fidelity, and usability metrics.",

FinGAT employs hierarchical learning for short-term and long-term sequential patterns, constructs fully-connected graphs for stocks and sectors using graph attention networks to learn latent interactions, and uses a multi-task objective for joint stock recommendation and movement prediction. Experiments on Taiwan Stock, S&P 500, and NASDAQ datasets demonstrate FinGAT's superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.",

Alpha2 formulates alpha discovery as a program construction problem, where an agent assembles alpha programs optimized for performance and diversity.

Sparse portfolio selection extends this by imposing a cardinality constraint, limiting investments to k assets from a universe of p. Traditional methods model this as a mixed-integer quadratic program, but their computational costs grow exponentially with k and p. This paper proposes a fast, gradient-based approach that transforms the combinatorial problem into a constrained continuous optimization via Boolean relaxation, preserving equivalence with the original problem. The algorithm uses a tunable parameter to transition the auxiliary objective from convex to concave, ensuring stable initialization and convergence to sparse binary solutions. Practical results show the method matches commercial solvers in asset selection with negligible variance errors.",

This paper introduces a novel attention mechanism that uses filters to extract time-invariant temporal patterns, akin to transforming data into its 'frequency domain'. The mechanism selects relevant time series and leverages their frequency domain information for forecasting. Applied to real-world tasks, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance in most cases.",

Pretrained LLMs show no advantage over models trained from scratch, fail to capture sequential dependencies in time series, and do not aid in few-shot settings.

UnetTSF utilizes Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) technology for feature extraction from time series data, replacing traditional decomposition into trend and seasonal terms. The model incorporates a fusion structure tailored for time series data. Extensive testing on 8 open-source datasets demonstrates UnetTSF's superiority over the best linear model, DLinear, achieving optimal results in 31 out of 32 test cases, with average reductions of 10.1% in MSE and 9.1% in MAE. Compared to the complex Transformer-based PatchTST, UnetTSF also shows competitive performance, securing 9 and 15 optimal results for MSE and MAE, respectively, in 32 test cases.",

Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for this task due to their ability to capture spatiotemporal dependencies.

This study proposes DishFT-GNN, a novel distillation-based future-aware GNN framework. DishFT-GNN employs a teacher model to learn correlations between historical and future data distributions, which then guides a student model to generate future-aware embeddings for accurate predictions.

These graphs serve as inputs to a GAT model trained with custom layers and a Sharpe ratio-derived loss function to maximize risk-adjusted returns.

While deep learning (DL) methods have shown promise, their performance is often unstable due to sensitivity to initialization and hyperparameters. Existing approaches typically use a single neural network predictor, which is inconsistent with real-world trading firms' workflows. To address this, we propose AlphaMix, a three-stage mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework for quantitative investment. Stage one involves an efficient ensemble learning method to train multiple groups of trading experts with personalized market understanding. Stage two builds a diversified expert pool using hyperparameter and initialization diversity. Stage three dynamically selects experts using mechanisms like as-needed routing and integrated expert soup. Experiments on US and Chinese markets show AlphaMix outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across seven financial criteria.",

Using the Black-Scholes delta hedge as a baseline and simulating data with a GJR-GARCH(1,1) model, the study finds that MCPG and PPO perform best in terms of the root semi-quadratic penalty. MCPG is the only algorithm to outperform the baseline, likely due to reward sparsity.

Despite extensive hyperparameter tuning, ML models fail to outperform HAR when the latter employs an optimized fitting approach. The HAR model's simplicity offers interpretability and significantly lower computational costs. Performance evaluation using QLIKE, MSE, and realized utility metrics consistently shows HAR's superiority over ML models when both rely on realized volatility and VIX as predictors. The findings emphasize the importance of proper fitting schemes and suggest that well-specified HAR models provide superior forecasting accuracy, offering practical guidelines for their application as a benchmark in volatility forecasting.",

    "abstract": "This paper introduces the Deep Risk Model, a deep learning solution designed to mine latent risk factors for improving covariance matrix estimation in portfolio risk management. Traditional methods rely on human-designed risk factors, which are time-consuming and effort-intensive. The proposed approach formulates risk factor mining as a learning problem, utilizing neural networks to automatically design risk factors. The learning objective ensures the factors effectively explain stock return variance while maintaining orthogonality and stability. Experiments on stock market data show the model achieves a 1.9% higher explained variance (R²) and reduces risk in a global minimum variance portfolio. The architecture combines Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) for temporal transformations and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for cross-sectional transformations, validated through comprehensive experiments.",

We introduce TIME-MOE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. Leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, TIME-MOE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. TIME-MOE comprises decoder-only transformer models that operate autoregressively and support flexible forecasting horizons. Pre-trained on the large-scale Time-300B dataset, spanning over 9 domains and 300 billion time points, TIME-MOE scales up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our models consistently outperform dense models with similar computational budgets, validating the applicability of scaling laws in time series forecasting.",

This issue causes Transformers to generate indistinguishable temporal attentions, limiting predictive capability. To address this, the authors propose Non-stationary Transformers, featuring Series Stationarization for better predictability and De-stationary Attention to recover intrinsic non-stationarity. This framework significantly enhances mainstream Transformers, reducing MSE by up to 49.43%, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting.",

Genetic programming (GP) can identify nonlinear factors automatically but lacks mechanisms for evaluating factor quality and produces overly complex formulas. To address these issues, we propose a Hierarchical Proximal Policy Optimization (HPPO) framework for automated factor generation and evaluation. HPPO uses two PPO models: a high-level policy to weight stock features and a low-level policy to identify latent nonlinear relationships using operators like sin(), +, and /. The Pearson correlation between generated factors and realized volatility serves as the reward signal. Transfer learning is incorporated by pre-training the high-level policy on historical High-Frequency Trading (HFT) data and fine-tuning it with recent data, enhancing adaptability. Experimental results show HPPO-TO achieves a 25% excess return in HFT markets across China, India, and the U.S.",

Experiments reveal that LLMs, including GPT-4o, struggle with algebraic reasoning when dealing with plain-text stock data, often focusing on local details rather than global trends. In contrast, LLMs perform significantly better with geometric reasoning when presented with visual data, such as scatter plots or K-line charts, suggesting that visual representations enhance numerical reasoning. The reflection module further improves this capability by aiding in the analysis and interpretation of complex data. Validation on the NASDAQ STOCK dataset confirms that LLMs demonstrate stronger reasoning with visual data compared to text.",

Traditional prediction methods focus on historical patterns but overlook critical factors like macroeconomic fluctuations, market sentiment, and technical indicators. This paper introduces CryptoPulse, a dual-prediction mechanism that integrates these factors to forecast next-day closing prices. The model leverages macroeconomic conditions, technical indicators, and individual cryptocurrency price changes, enhanced by a market sentiment-based refinement mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming ten comparison methods. The framework also includes a novel prompting strategy for LLM-based sentiment analysis of cryptocurrency news. The dataset and code are publicly available.",

Recent research indicates that ML is valuable in asset pricing due to its ability to capture nonlinearities and interaction effects missed by traditional models. However, financial market data often lacks large datasets and high signal-to-noise ratios, which are crucial for ML effectiveness. The paper also discusses challenges such as the evolving nature of financial markets, positive publication bias, overfitting, and the relevance of historical data. While ML shows promise, its superior performance is often overstated, and human expertise remains essential. The study concludes that a disciplined research process can help investors benefit from ML-based strategies despite these challenges.",

Unlike traditional limit order book data, message data includes failed trade or cancel attempts, allowing observation of both winners and losers in high-speed trading races. The study finds that latency-arbitrage races are frequent (about one per minute per symbol for FTSE 100 stocks), extremely fast (modal race duration is 5-10 microseconds), and account for a significant portion of trading volume (around 20%). Participation is concentrated, with the top six firms responsible for over 80% of race wins and losses. Although individual races are small (averaging half a price tick), the cumulative impact is substantial. The paper estimates that races constitute roughly one-third of price impact and the effective spread, impose a 0.5 basis point tax on trading, and suggest that eliminating latency arbitrage could reduce liquidity costs by 17%. The global equity market stakes are estimated at $5 billion annually.",

The study also reveals that predictors supported by peer-reviewed risk explanations or equilibrium models underperform post-sample, suggesting peer review may mislabel mispricing as risk. Data mining uncovers similar themes as academic research, such as investment, issuance, and accruals, often decades before publication. The findings challenge the belief that economic theory inherently improves out-of-sample robustness compared to data mining.",

    "abstract": "Price Trend Prediction (PTP) based on Limit Order Book (LOB) data is a fundamental challenge in financial markets. Despite advances in deep learning, existing models fail to generalize across different market conditions and assets. We propose TLOB, a transformer-based model that uses a dual attention mechanism to capture spatial and temporal dependencies in LOB data, making it effective for longer-horizon predictions and volatile market conditions. We introduce a new labeling method that removes horizon bias and evaluate TLOB's effectiveness across four horizons using the FI-2010 benchmark, achieving an average 3.7 F1-score improvement over state-of-the-art. TLOB also shows improvements on Tesla and Intel stocks and outperforms on a Bitcoin dataset. Our work highlights declining stock price predictability over time and the challenges of translating trend classification into profitable trading strategies.",

Unlike traditional methods starting from white Gaussian noise, ARMD uses chain-based diffusion with priors, modeling series evolution and leveraging intermediate states for improved accuracy. Our approach reinterprets diffusion by considering future series as the initial state and historical series as the final state, aligning the sampling process with forecasting objectives.

Traditional factor models rely on linear combinations of expert-designed factors, which may not capture complex market behaviors. FactorGCL addresses this by employing a hypergraph structure to model high-order nonlinear relationships among stocks and factors. The model uses a cascading residual hypergraph architecture to extract hidden factors from residual information after accounting for prior factors. Additionally, a temporal residual contrastive learning method is proposed to enhance the extraction of effective hidden factors by contrasting stock-specific residuals across different time periods. Experimental results on real stock market data demonstrate that FactorGCL outperforms existing methods and successfully mines hidden factors for improved stock return predictions.",

This paper proposes a novel Two-Level Conv-LSTM Neural Network integrated with a Large Language Model (LLM) for comprehensive stock advising. The model harnesses the strengths of Conv-LSTM for analyzing time-series data and LLM for processing and understanding textual information from financial news, social media, and reports. In the first level, convolutional layers are employed to identify local patterns in historical stock prices and technical indicators, followed by LSTM layers to capture the temporal dynamics. The second level integrates the output with an LLM that analyzes sentiment and contextual information from textual data, providing a holistic view of market conditions.

By leveraging LLMs' extensive world knowledge and reasoning capabilities, LLMoE integrates historical price data and stock news for more effective and interpretable expert selection. Experiments on real-world stock datasets demonstrate that LLMoE outperforms state-of-the-art MoE models and other deep learning approaches, while its flexible architecture allows for easy adaptation to various downstream tasks.",

KANs demonstrate superior accuracy and interpretability, achieving comparable or better performance with smaller architectures in data fitting and PDE solving. They exhibit faster neural scaling laws and can be intuitively visualized, making them useful for scientific discovery in mathematics and physics. KANs combine the strengths of splines and MLPs, mitigating their respective weaknesses, and offer a new foundation for improving deep learning models.",

Key advantages include handling missing data without imputation, incorporating textual side information, and explaining predictions. The study also explores how LLMs' biases for simplicity and repetition align with time series patterns like seasonality, and notes that performance generally scales with model size, though alignment interventions like RLHF can degrade calibration.",

To address this, we propose EarnMore, an RL framework with maskable stock representation that handles PM with CSPs through one-shot training in a global stock pool (GSP). Key innovations include a masking mechanism for stocks outside the target pool, self-supervised learning for stock representations, and a re-weighting mechanism to focus on favorable stocks. Experiments on 8 subset stock pools from the US market demonstrate EarnMore's superiority over 14 baselines, with over 40% profit improvement.",

The evaluation is conducted using data of various frequencies: 5 minute, 15 minute, and 30 minute intervals, over the 6 different periods. Although the Informer-based model with Quantile loss did not outperform the benchmark, two other models achieved better results. The performance of the model using RMSE loss worsens when used with higher frequency data while the model that uses novel GMADL loss function is benefiting from higher frequency data and when trained on 5 minute interval it beat all the other strategies on most of the testing periods.",

This paper introduces SAMBA, an innovative framework that combines the Mamba architecture with graph neural networks (GNNs) for stock return prediction. SAMBA achieves near-linear computational complexity by using a bidirectional Mamba block to capture long-term dependencies in historical price data and adaptive graph convolution to model dependencies between daily stock features. Experimental results show that SAMBA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in prediction performance while maintaining low computational complexity.",

Using automatic differentiation and custom loss functions, the method calibrates order allocation to minimize VWAP slippage. Results show this approach consistently outperforms conventional methods, even with a naive linear model, highlighting the advantage of directly modeling the execution objective.

This allows the use of first-order optimization algorithms for gradient computation, enabling compatibility with state-of-the-art solvers. Experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that BPQP significantly improves efficiency, achieving up to an order of magnitude faster execution compared to existing differentiable optimization layers.

The hierarchical VAE captures complex latent variables, while the diffusion model handles stochasticity by progressively adding noise to input data. Additionally, a coupled diffusion process augments the target price sequence, followed by a denoising step to improve generalizability. Experimental results show that D-Va outperforms state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy and variance.

The method adaptively integrates social events into forecasting models, aligning news content with time series fluctuations to provide richer insights. LLM-based agents iteratively filter out irrelevant news and employ human-like reasoning to evaluate predictions, enabling the model to analyze complex events and continuously refine the selection logic of news and the robustness of the agent’s output. By integrating selected news events with time series data, a pre-trained LLM is fine-tuned to predict sequences of digits in time series. The results demonstrate significant improvements in forecasting accuracy, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in time series forecasting through the effective utilization of unstructured news data.",

The authors propose LIFT, a method that dynamically estimates leading indicators and their leading steps, then uses this information to refine forecasts. LIFT acts as a plug-in compatible with any time series forecasting method. Experiments on six real-world datasets show that LIFT improves state-of-the-art methods by an average of 5.5%.

Nevertheless, humans win 'Man vs. Machine' when institutional knowledge is crucial, e.g., involving intangible assets and financial distress. AI wins when information is transparent but voluminous. Humans provide significant incremental value in 'Man + Machine,' which also substantially reduces extreme errors. Analysts catch up with machines after 'alternative data' become available if their employers build AI capabilities. Documented synergies between humans and machines inform how humans can leverage their advantage for better adaptation to the growing AI prowess.",

Existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods often report increased profits in backtesting but may suffer from false positives due to model overfitting. This paper proposes a practical approach to address backtest overfitting for cryptocurrency trading using DRL. The method formulates overfitting detection as a hypothesis test, trains DRL agents, estimates overfitting probability, and rejects overfitted agents to improve trading performance. Testing on 10 cryptocurrencies during a period with two market crashes (05/01/2022 to 06/27/2022) shows that less overfitted DRL agents achieve higher returns than overfitted agents, an equal weight strategy, and the S&P DBM Index, suggesting potential real-market applicability.",

Traditional methods require extensive manual design and suffer from misalignment between prediction and optimization goals. To address these challenges, we introduce Direct Sorted Portfolio Optimization (DSPO), an innovative end-to-end framework that efficiently processes raw stock data to construct sorted portfolios directly. DSPO's neural network architecture seamlessly transitions stock data from input to output while modeling intra-dependency of time-steps and inter-dependency among all tradable stocks. Additionally, we incorporate a novel Monotonical Logistic Regression loss to maximize the likelihood of constructing optimal sorted portfolios. Empirical results demonstrate DSPO's effectiveness, yielding a RankIC of 10.12% and an accumulated return of 121.94% on the New York Stock Exchange in 2023-2024.",

This paper introduces the Adaptive Long-Short Pattern Transformer (ALSP-TF) for stock ranking by expected returns. ALSP-TF enhances canonical self-attention with a fine-grained pattern distiller to contextualize queries and keys based on localized feature scales and a time-adaptive modulator to adjust dependency modeling across different time intervals. Additionally, a graph self-supervised regularization is devised to automatically assimilate stock synergies, improving model generalization. Experiments on three exchange market datasets demonstrate ALSP-TF's superiority over state-of-the-art stock forecast methods.",

The framework eliminates the need for expert-annotated training samples by using self-generated responses during the reflective process. Experimental results show that the SEP framework outperforms traditional deep-learning and LLM methods in prediction accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient for stock classification tasks, and demonstrates effectiveness in portfolio construction.",

The proposed method addresses this by simulating price stochasticity through intentional perturbations during training, ensuring the model performs well under such variations.
