These functions allow models like transformers to generate significant profits on a portfolio of 50 S&P 500 stocks, outperforming reinforcement learning benchmarks and buy-and-hold methods. For instance, the Crossformer model adapted with the best loss function achieved returns of 51.42%, 51.04%, and 48.62% in 2021-2023 test periods, surpassing PPO and DDPG methods.",

    "abstract": "This paper provides a theoretical analysis of the 1/N diversification rule in portfolio management. It demonstrates that estimated investment strategies fail to achieve optimal Sharpe ratios in high-dimensional settings relative to sample size, while the 1/N rule proves optimal under a 1-factor model with diversifiable risks as dimensionality increases. The study explores conditions where the 1/N rule can be outperformed: combining it with estimated rules when N is small, and integrating it with anomalies or machine learning portfolios when N is large, conditional on their profitability. The findings explain the practical difficulty in beating the 1/N rule and offer tractable solutions under specific scenarios.",

The SEP framework employs a self-reflective agent and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to autonomously teach an LLM to generate predictions and explanations. It summarizes input texts, uses self-reflection to learn from past movements, and fine-tunes the model with self-generated samples, eliminating the need for human annotation.

Using Apple Inc. closing price data from the past decade, models were trained and evaluated based on RMSE and convergence speed. Results show that GRU models optimized with Adam achieved the lowest RMSE, outperforming other combinations in accuracy and efficiency. GRU models generally surpassed LSTM models, and Adam outperformed NAG across both architectures, suggesting GRU with Adam is optimal for practical stock price prediction.",

The system employs three key mechanisms: originality enforcement through AST-based similarity measures, hypothesis-factor alignment via LLM semantic consistency evaluation, and complexity control through structural constraints. These mechanisms guide alpha generation to balance originality, financial rationale, and market adaptability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate AlphaAgent's effectiveness in mitigating alpha decay, achieving significant excess returns in both Chinese CSI 500 and U.S. S&P 500 markets while maintaining robust performance across different market regimes.",

LLMs achieve performance comparable to or better than specialized time series models, benefiting from their ability to represent multimodal distributions, handle missing data without imputation, incorporate textual side information, and provide explanations.

They formalize a data generation process with interventions on short-term states and establish an identification theory for disentanglement.

Transfer learning pre-trains the high-level policy on historical data and fine-tunes it with recent data, improving adaptability. The Pearson correlation with realized volatility serves as the reward. Experiments across U.S., Chinese, and Indian markets show a 25% excess return compared to baselines.",

Unlike prior methods relying on keyphrases or sentiment analysis, LLMFactor focuses on identifying directly relevant factors, providing clear explanations for temporal changes. The approach involves generating background knowledge via fill-in-the-blank prompts, discerning factors from news, and leveraging historical stock prices in textual format for prediction. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets from U.S. and Chinese markets, LLMFactor outperforms state-of-the-art methods in financial time-series forecasting and enhances explainability.",

AlphaEvolve generates alphas that model scalar, vector, and matrix features, achieving high accuracy and weak correlation.

Performance analysis reveals that smaller investors suffer from poor stock selection and high trading costs, while larger investors' stock selection abilities are offset by trading costs.

Using a GJR-GARCH(1,1) model for simulation and Black-Scholes delta hedge as baseline, results show MCPG and PPO perform best in minimizing root semi-quadratic penalty risk. MCPG is the only algorithm to outperform the baseline under the given computational constraints, attributed to reward sparsity.

Contrary to prior literature, it finds little evidence that ETF trading transmits shocks to underlying portfolios. Panel vector autoregression shows ETF returns primarily follow underlying returns, not vice versa. Mispricing events are preceded by underlying price and order imbalance shocks, corrected by ETF quote adjustments without arbitrage activity. Daily frequency analysis also reveals minimal relation between ETFs and underlying market quality, suggesting ETFs may shield portfolios from demand shocks rather than propagate noise.",

SusGen-GPT models, trained on this curated dataset with only 7-8B parameters, achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, performing nearly on par with GPT-4 (within 0.02 average score) despite being significantly smaller than GPT-4's 1,700B parameters. This demonstrates an efficient approach to delivering high performance with fewer computational resources.",

    "abstract": "This paper addresses the challenge of applying reinforcement learning (RL) to stock trading by framing it as an offline RL problem. Existing methods often produce policies that overfit to historical data and fail to generalize to out-of-distribution market conditions. The proposed method, MetaTrader, introduces a bilevel actor-critic approach that operates on both original stock data and its transformations to enhance generalization. Additionally, it employs a conservative TD learning variant with ensemble-based targets to mitigate value overestimation, especially with limited offline data. Empirical results on two public datasets show MetaTrader outperforms both RL-based and stock prediction models.",

The authors propose an economics-driven loss function that places GANs in a supervised learning setting, enabling full conditional probability distribution forecasts of price returns rather than point estimates. The method outperforms classical models like LSTM and ARIMA in terms of Sharpe Ratio on equity data, provides uncertainty estimates, and helps alleviate mode collapse issues in GANs. It also demonstrates scalability and the ability to learn from co-movements across different assets and sectors.",

The Street price-earnings ratio is shown to be driven by future returns rather than earnings growth, reconciling the Campbell-Shiller decomposition with the excess volatility puzzle.

Performance is compared against Buy and Hold and technical indicator-based benchmarks across multiple frequencies (5, 15, and 30 minutes) and periods. While the Quantile loss model underperformed, the RMSE and GMADL models showed improved results, with GMADL excelling at higher frequencies. The research demonstrates that Informer with GMADL loss can yield superior trading outcomes, contributing a framework for strategy comparison and open-source implementation.",

The strategy is applied across equity indices, currencies, government bonds, and interest rates, using four macroeconomic themes: business cycle, international trade, monetary policy, and risk sentiment. Backtested from 1970, it demonstrates strong positive returns, low correlation with traditional assets, and diversification benefits during bear markets and rising yield environments, complementing other alternative strategies like trend-following.",

The proposed approach uses a graph attention network to aggregate individual firm features and signals from neighboring firms in a node-level forecasting task.

TEMPO addresses the challenge of adapting large pre-trained models to time series data by incorporating two key inductive biases: decomposition of time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components, and the use of soft prompts to facilitate distribution adaptation across different time series types. The model demonstrates superior performance in zero-shot settings on multiple benchmark datasets, including scenarios with unseen datasets and multimodal inputs. TEMPO's architecture enables effective representation learning and shows potential as a foundational framework for time series modeling.",

The study explores four explanations: changes in firm composition, migrations between indices, front-running by arbitrageurs, and increased market liquidity. It concludes that migrations and enhanced liquidity are primary drivers, with limited roles for composition changes and front-running, offering implications for market efficiency.",

Using a meta-learning approach with 118 training and 90 test datasets, the study demonstrates that RealMLP offers competitive accuracy with faster training times compared to other neural baselines and is on par with GBDTs. The improved defaults enable strong out-of-the-box performance without hyperparameter tuning, and some enhancements also benefit TabR, showcasing broad applicability.",

Unlike traditional single-branch models, MERA uses multiple independent experts for differentiated modeling and a GateNet to dynamically allocate data to the most suitable experts. To overcome the lack of explicit pattern identifiers, it leverages self-supervised pre-training to create high-level representations, retrieves similar samples, and uses their label information to guide allocation. Extensive experiments on real-world stock markets demonstrate significant performance improvements, and MERA is a plug-and-play module compatible with any deep learning-based model.",

The method uses channel-independent processing to overcome distribution shift in financial time series and constructs dynamic hypergraphs based on stock similarity using Dynamic Time Warping. The framework employs Transformer and HGAT for self-supervised pre-training followed by stock-ranking fine-tuning. Experiments on NASDAQ and NYSE data over five years demonstrate superior performance in investment return ratio and Sharpe ratio compared to state-of-the-art approaches, with notable improvements in prediction accuracy and stability.",
